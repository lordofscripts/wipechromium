## Platform-specific

The following are platform-specific notes about the program's functionality,
and/or the Release assets (deliverables).

### Linux & Unix

* *Fully operational* (Chromium supported). All tests pass. The deliverable is
  not in compressed form and requires `chmod ugo+x` to be made executable.)

### Microsoft Windows

* Windows build *not tested* (need feedback on Cache & Profile folders as I
  don't have a Windows machine). Therefore, **use at your own risk!**. ) It
  uses folders based on the information available on Internet.
* If downloaded from Release Assets, you must rename the file to EXE with
  `rename wipechromium wipechromium.exe`

### MacOS

* MacOS build *not tested* (need feedback on folders). I don't have a Mac
  machine available to me.
